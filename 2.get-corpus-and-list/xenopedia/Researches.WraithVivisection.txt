<desc>Amputation of the glowing nodes on either side of the prisoner's head appears to have stripped it of the power of teleportation - though I will retain the armed guards to ensure we are not being deceived. As usual, a summary of the creature's vulnerabilities has been distributed to your men and should increase their combat effectiveness by roughly ten percent.&#10;&#10;The Wraith is a genuinely alien beast. While other specimens watch sullenly from inside their glass prisons as we work, our captive Wraith is distractingly twitchy - it refuses to expose its back to us, instead turning its whole body to face whoever is closest to the holding tank. If approached simultaneously from different directions, it will spin on the spot until they leave (for literally hours at a time if necessary). Your men find this hilarious, but it is utterly infuriating if one is trying to concentrate.&#10;&#10;Ridiculous mannerisms aside, the Wraith scored excellently on all tests performed - demonstrating high levels of intelligence, superb sensory awareness and lightning reflexes. They are also capable marksmen and their physiology is deceptively resilient, even without their subdermal armour. The power of teleportation only makes them more effective; we have verified accounts of the beasts teleporting straight through the walls of a sealed room. Thankfully, there appears to be a limited range on this ability and the aliens take some time to re-adjust to their surroundings after having made a &quot;jump&quot;, preventing them from firing their weapons immediately. Nevertheless, I suggest your soldiers watch their backs as closely as this beast guards its own.</desc>
