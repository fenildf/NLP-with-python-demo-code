<desc>The X-120 &quot;Fury&quot; interceptor is the ultimate weapon in the battle for our skies. It is an unmanned craft with virtually unlimited range that can fly so high and so fast that no UFO has a hope of outrunning it, let alone intercepting it. It can travel at Mach 8 (some 10,000 kilometers per hour), allowing it to reach any point in the world in under two hours. It carries a single super-heavy Singularity Torpedo on each mission.&#10;&#10;The Fury was influenced by the allegedly secret SR-71 &quot;Blackbird&quot;, which is almost invulnerable to conventional technology due to its impressive speed and service ceiling (not that our organisation would have much trouble dealing with them). The design has been evolved and enhanced, not least by removing the pilot and the equipment required to keep him alive. An autonomous flight computer tracks sensor data against mission parameters, adjusting its behaviour to ensure the mission is completed as quickly and safely as possible. The engines are a three-stage turbojet / ramjet / scramjet design where each stage speed the craft to the point at which the following stage can kick in.&#10;&#10;The scramjets engage at Mach 4 and each produce 75,000 lbs. of thrust, rapidly accelerating the Fury to Mach 8. At these speeds air resistance heats the surface of the craft to 4,000 degrees Celsius, ordinarily impossible to sustain without a spacecraft-style ablative coating that requires replacement after every flight. However, hardened alien alloys have proved more than capable of resisting that sort of temperature indefinitely - allowing the Fury to travel so quickly that it is entirely immune to damage from enemy UFOs. Unfortunately, as weapons also need to be designed specifically for hypersonic launch, the speed of the craft also limits the weapons that can be carried to just one: the super-heavy Singularity Torpedo.&#10;&#10;Unsurprisingly, the power requirements for these monstrous engines and the highly advanced flight computer are enormous. A Singularity Core is the only viable power source, so each Fury built will require us to capture one from an extraterrestrial capital ship.</desc>
<cdesc>X-120 “狂怒”截击机是战场上守护我们天空的终极武器。它是一种无人驾驶飞行器，拥有无限宽广的飞行空间，能够飞得如此之高、如此之快，以至于UFO甚至连追上它的机会都没有，更别提拦截它了。它能以8马赫速度飞行（相当于1万多公里的时速），到达世界上任意地点的时间不会超过两小时。每个任务中它仅携带一枚超重型“奇点鱼雷”。&#10;&#10;受到传说中那款拥有着惊人的飞行速度与实用升限，在常规技术面前无懈可击的神秘的SR-71“黑鸟”的影响（当然我们组织可以轻松解决掉它们）。对这种飞行器的设计不断进化与增强，远不止移除飞行员和他的生命维持装备这么简单。一台自控飞航电脑追踪传感器数据并与任务参数进行比对，进而调整自身状态以确保在尽可能安全的前提下快速完成任务。引擎被设计成涡轮喷气/冲压式喷气/超音速燃烧冲压喷气三段式，前一段引擎负责将飞行器加速至某一设定值，下一段引擎介入并接力加速。&#10;&#10;超音速燃烧冲压喷气发动机在4马赫时介入，提供75000磅的推力，迅速将“狂怒”加速至8马赫。在这种高速下，空气阻力与飞行器表面摩擦，会使表面温度持续加热至4000摄氏度高温，除非包裹有航天器级别的烧蚀层并在每次飞行后进行更换，否则一般的飞行器根本无法承受。但是，锻造后的外星合金已被证明有能力轻松抵御如此高的温度，且可以无限期的重复使用——这让“狂怒”能够进行超高速飞行，并完全免于受到UFO舰船的伤害。不幸的是，由于武器同样也需要为进行特超音速发射而特殊设计，因此在飞行器速度的制约下，可选装备的武器只剩下一种：超重型“奇点鱼雷”。&#10;&#10;显而易见的是，这些巨兽般引擎以及高度先进的飞控电脑对能源有着巨大的需求。只有奇点核芯才是唯一可行的能源，因此，每建造一艘“狂怒”就要求我们必须捕获一艘外星旗舰飞船。</cdesc>
