<desc>The Heavy Fighter is a small alien air superiority craft. It is much tougher than the Fighter UFO and possesses weapons systems capable of shredding a conventional interceptor such as the Condor in moments. &#10;&#10;The wings of the vessel house most of the vital systems (avionics, thrusters, weapons), with surviving fragments suggesting that all of these are significantly more advanced than their equivalents on the basic Fighter. It seems that the craft houses a reactor in each wing, making significantly more power available to the various components - this is probably what makes the Heavy Fighter so much more formidable than its predecessor.&#10;&#10;Dismantling the central saucer reveals the identity of the pilots. A Harridan lies sealed inside the craft's saucer, curled into the foetal position and plugged directly into the UFO's sensors and control systems. The creature's armour draws power from the craft reactor and provides all required life support functions, making it likely that the pilots are permanently incarcerated within their craft when built.</desc>
<cdesc>重型战斗机是一种小型的外星制空战斗飞行器。它比战斗机更加的坚固，并且拥有能够在短时间内撕碎像鹰式战机一样的传统拦截机的武器系统。&#10;&#10;飞船的机翼上搭载了大多数的重要设施（航空电子设备、推进器、武器），根据对机体残骸的分析，机身上的设备比基础战斗机的同类设备都要先进。飞船的两个机翼上各有一个反应堆，使其他的组件能够获取更多的能量——这也许是重型战斗机比战斗机更加可怕的原因。&#10;&#10;通过分解中部的飞盘揭示了飞行员的真面目。一个Harridan躺在密封的飞碟座舱内，直接插进UFO的感应器和控制系统之间的婴儿大小的空间里，蜷曲着。这个生物的护甲从飞船的反应堆里汲取能量以提供所有生存必须的功能，就好像是驾驶员在飞船制造的时候就被监禁在里边一样。</cdesc>
