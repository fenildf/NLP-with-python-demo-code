<desc>The D-42 Shrike is a VTOL aircraft that combines the functionality of a helicopter with the performance of a conventional aircraft. It is a major upgrade on the CH-48 Charlie, being much faster and able to carry more troops. It is also better equipped for operating in urban spaces; any mission that involves large helicopters disembarking troops in built-up areas is a recipe for disaster - indeed, it is testament to the skill of our pilots that none of our missions have begun with a bungled landing and deadly fireball.&#10;&#10;The Shrike is a rugged, boxy creation that is as effective as it is ugly. It uses a pair of tilting TF-19 turbofan engines to cruise through the air at supersonic speeds and then perform a vertical landing on arrival at the target site. These monstrous turbines are themselves driven by two sizeable ER-12 Alenium reactors, providing enough power to keep even a fully-loaded craft airborne for days - in fact, the range limitation of the craft is due to pilot fatigue rather than fuel capacity.&#10;&#10;However, the most important result of these new engines is a greater carrying capacity than the CH-48 Charlie. The Shrike can carry up to ten soldiers (rather than eight) inside its armoured troop compartment, which has large ramps at both the front and the rear to allow safer disembarkation in a hazardous landing zone. One does not need a brain as large as mine to see that bringing  a quarter more soldiers into battle will significantly increase our chances of victory.</desc>
<cdesc>D-42 “百舌鸟” 是一种结合了直升机功能和常规飞行器性能的垂直起降飞行器。它是CH-48 “查理” 的主要升级型号，速度更快，能够运送更多部队。同时，为了适应城市区域的行动，它也拥有更精良的装备；由大型直升机在城市建筑区进行登陆部队投送，对任何任务而言都可能意味着灾难性的后果——然事实上，我们的任务没有一次是在糟糕的着陆和致命的火球中开始的，这可以作为我们的飞行员拥有高超本领的明证。&#10;&#10;“百舌鸟”有着粗狂方正的外行，非常实用高效但也非常的丑。它使用一对倾斜布置的TF-19 涡轮风扇引擎，能以超音速进行空中巡航，然后垂直降落在目标地点。这些巨大 的涡轮机由两台大型ER-12 Alenium 反应堆驱动，输出的能量足以供给一架满载的空运飞行器数天之久——事实上，限制它航程的并非燃料储量，而是飞行员的疲劳。&#10;&#10;然而，这些新引擎所带来的最重要的改变还是相对CH-48 “查理” 而言，更强的装载能力。“百舌鸟” 能搭载多达十名士兵（而非之前的八人），全部容纳于带装甲的部队仓室内，拥有前后两条大型坡道，为危险降落区的登陆行动提供了更安全的解决方案。即使不像我这么有头脑的人都能明白，多带四分之一数量的士兵奔赴战场将会显著提高我们的胜算。</cdesc>
