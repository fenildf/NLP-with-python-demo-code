<desc>A Sebillian is a reptilian alien, standing roughly 195cm (6 feet 5 inches) tall and weighing nearly two hundred kilograms. The incredibly dense skeleton of the creature and its tough, scaled hide together account for some 40% of this (the remainder being largely muscle and teeth). Whatever environment the Sebillians evolved in must have been a hostile one; their physiology is hardy to the point where I struggle to think of a creature capable of killing one. &#10;&#10;With up to an inch of scaled hide in places, these creatures have some inherent protection against ballistic weapons. Beneath the scales is a thick layer of dense muscle and the creature's heavy skeleton, both also heavily resistant to damage. Once we had abandoned our bone saws for an angle grinder, we revealed the creature's internal organs. These were much to be expected, the only major anomaly being the presence of two hearts inside the torso. Presumably one alone could not pump sufficient blood around the beast's body to sustain it? Analysis of Sebillian blood also has some interesting results: almost ten percent of blood volume is comprised of a mixture of powerful coagulants and unspecialised stem cells. We do not yet fully understand the implications of this, but it is quite possible that live Sebillians are able to rapidly clot wounds and possibly even regenerate damage sustained in combat. &#10;&#10;Some consolation: despite the above, Sebillians are not perfect soldiers. Much like the brutes down in our engineering department, their physique belies an undersize brain - a Sebillian probably has as much understanding of squad tactics as it does the finer points of Shakespeare. They also have weak thermal eyesight, giving them slower reflexes and poor accuracy (although smoke will not hinder their accuracy like it does other aliens). They will prefer to fight at short ranges where these characteristics are less of a hindrance, so it would be wise to ensure the opposite occurs. </desc>
