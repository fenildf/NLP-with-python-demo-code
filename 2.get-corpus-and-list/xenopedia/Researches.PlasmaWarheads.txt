<desc>The development of plasma-based explosives has also allowed us to improve the design of our air-to-air munitions, creating a new generation of weapons that replace the existing Alenium warheads with more advanced technology. &#10;&#10;Our current Alenium warheads are certainly powerful explosives, but unfortunately they must rely on this explosive energy for their armour penetration - hardly ideal against armour designed specifically to resist the heat from orbital re-entry. It proved more effective to use a portion of the energy in the Alenium to power a small plasma generator that forms a superheated globe of energy at the front of the warhead as it detonates. This acts like a plasma &quot;drill&quot; and melts a path through the armour, the thrust from the rocket engines providing the momentum needed for penetration. &#10;&#10;The remaining energy in the warhead is then used to generate an explosion in the same manner as in a conventional Alenium warhead. The energy drained by the previous stage means this explosion is smaller than before, but the greater penetration of the warhead means that it will actually inflict 40-50% more damage. In all other respects the warheads are identical to the previous generation; we can fit them to our existing rocket motors and produce the new missiles in large numbers at negligible cost. I have taken the liberty of re-equipping our aircraft accordingly.</desc>
