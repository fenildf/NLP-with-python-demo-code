<desc>Much of the explosive power of a conventional two-stage thermonuclear / hydrogen bomb comes from the initial fission explosion that ignites the fusion reaction, rather than the fusion reaction itself. Unfortunately, the initial fission explosion also causes the lethal radioactive fallout that can linger for decades afterwards. &#10;&#10;Pure fusion explosives are smaller, cleaner and more deadly still. Only a commander with minimal attachment to his infantry would issue them with short-range thermonuclear weapons...but pure fusion micro-explosives are perfectly viable battlefield weapons. They are extremely powerful and can be made small enough that the user would not be caught in the blast of their own weapon, whilst the clean reaction means they can be used freely in friendly territory without fear of radioactive contamination.&#10;&#10;All that is required for a pure fusion explosive is a burst of energy that sufficiently powerful to ignite fusion between the deuterium and tritium in the warhead. Low-grade Alenium contains enough energy to do this without any of the side-effects of a fission bomb, allowing us to develop pure fusion rockets / grenades for your men that are significantly more powerful than the previous plasma explosives. However, please ensure that your men use the darkened glasses / visors provided - whilst I accept they are not particularly fashionable, I doubt catastrophic retinal burns are considered particularly attractive either. </desc>
<cdesc>传统的二阶式氢弹的爆炸威力不止来自聚变反应，还包括了用来引发聚变的核裂变爆炸。不幸的是，核裂变会在现场遗留下能滞留几十年的致命辐射。 &#10;&#10;单阶段的聚变武器能够做的更灵活、更清洁而且更致命。只有最不爱惜属下的指挥官才会让他的步兵装备装备近程热核武器...但纯核聚变的小型爆炸物却是完美的战场武器，既拥有极强的杀伤性又能做的足够小以避免使用者被爆炸波及到，而且核聚变的无污染性可以让它即使在友军领土上也能随意使用而不用担心放射物污染。&#10;&#10;纯核聚变的秘诀在于如何制造一个能激发弹头中的氘和氚的聚变反应的能量爆发。次等的Alenium便有足够的能量，而且没有核裂变的副作用，这让我们可以为士兵们开发威力远超等离子爆炸物的核聚变火箭/手雷。另外，请让你的人一定戴上附赠的护目镜 - 我承认那看上去挺土气，或许灾难性的视网膜灼伤会更酷一些。 </cdesc>
