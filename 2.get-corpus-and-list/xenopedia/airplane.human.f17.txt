<desc>The F-17 Condor is the primary Xenonaut interceptor aircraft, a general purpose dogfighter derived from the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Condor's Autocannon makes it well-suited to destroying smaller craft, whilst it also carries Sidewinder light missiles to make it a credible threat to medium-size vessels.&#10;&#10;The Condor has broadly similar performance to its parent aircraft but uses a modified airframe built from a titanium / magnesium alloy that gives the interceptor a reduced payload, but significantly longer range and improved durability. The alterations to the airframe have been made based on our studies of F-4 Phantoms damaged during the Iceland Incident. Components containing titanium or magnesium appeared to sustain less damage than those made of aluminium or other materials, suggesting some inherent resistance to alien energy weapons. We hope this reinforced airframe will make our Condors more capable against alien UFOs than interceptors from conventional air forces. &#10;&#10;The increased range is believed necessary - we have rather a lot of planet to protect. This has reduced the payload of the Condor, but it is still able to carry two light missiles and a craft cannon. This is a versatile combination; Sidewinder missiles have been proved effective and reliable against human aircraft, but we do not even know if we will be able to get a missile lock on alien vessels. The cannon has a shorter range and fires powerful shells that should be useful in a dogfight. One of the two weapons should hopefully prove effective against an enemy vessel.</desc>
<cdesc>F-17 “神鹰” 是一种衍生自F-16 “战隼”且用途广泛的近距格斗机型，是Xenonaut 的主力截击飞行器。“神鹰” 的机炮使其非常适合消灭小型飞行器，与此同时，它搭载的“响尾蛇”轻型导弹也会对中型舰船造成可观的威胁。&#10;&#10;“神鹰” 与其前辈机型拥有高度相似的性能表现，但是由于使用钛镁合金对机身结构进行了改良，在降低有效载荷的代价下，显著的提升了航程长度和机体耐久度。这项针对机体结构的改进是在研究了冰岛事件中受损的F-4 “鬼怪”之后做出的。含有钛或镁元素的部件似乎比那些用铝或其他材料制成的部件遭受到较少的伤害，这暗示对外星能量武器存在某种内在的抵抗能力。我们希望这种加强版的机体结构能使“神鹰” 在对抗外星UFO时比传统空军的截击机发挥更好的作用。&#10;&#10;我们有理由相信增加飞行航程的必要性——有大量的星球需要得到保护。虽然这减少了“神鹰” 的有效载荷，但其仍能携带两枚轻型导弹和一挺机炮。这是一种万精油式的通用组合；“响尾蛇” 导弹已被证明在对抗人类飞行器时足够有效，但我们仍不确定是否能够成功锁定一艘外星舰船。机炮射程较短但射出的炮弹威力十足，应该能在狗斗中发挥作用。其中一种武器有希望被证明在对付敌军舰船时是行之有效的。</cdesc>
