<desc>The alien Hyperdrive is the extraterrestrial faster-than-light drive, allowing their vessels to &quot;jump&quot; distances in a few days that would ordinarily take thousands of years to traverse. It is a gateway to another dimension of the multiverse (&quot;hyperspace&quot;), which is of equivalent size but has rather different set of laws to our own.&#10;&#10;The Hyperdrive is a large cylinder roughly 5 metres long and 1.5 metres wide. A plasma-filled tube runs the full length of the device, suspended within four rotating electromagnetic rings. The power requirements of the device mean we have only been able to test it on microscopic objects (sadly none of your engineers were willing to donate their brain), but I believe I have discovered how it works. The electromagnets and the plasma tube together generate a magnetic field around the target, which acts as a &quot;tunnel&quot; between two linked points in hyperspace. In effect, the target is occupying two different locations at once - both of which are in another dimension.&#10;&#10;Once this hyperspace &quot;tunnel&quot; has been created, the device disengages. The target is promptly returned to our own dimension, but cannot simultaneously exist in two places at once so is forced to occupy only one. Crucially, it appears the device somehow ensures that the destination point is always chosen over the origin point. Objects can therefore be transported almost unlimited distances with ease, although increased distance between the destination and origin does lead to increased power consumption.&#10;&#10;I do not know how this hyperspace gateway is opened, nor explain the dramatically different laws of physics at work there - that work can be done once the war is over. All we need to know is that this device works, and that we must find a way to disable it.</desc>
