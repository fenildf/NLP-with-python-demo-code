<desc>Pure fusion explosives are rather simple to scale up, making it easy to produce air-to-air variants for our interceptors to use. We are upgrading our aircraft munitions to the new Fusion Missile and Fusion Torpedo designs as we speak.&#10;&#10;These Fusion weapons inflict more damage than the Plasma warheads they replace, but otherwise operate in a similar manner. The yield of the warheads is actually rather small compared to what we could achieve (the Fusion Missile is approximately 0.5 kilotons and the Torpedo 2 kilotons), but we have not designed these weapons for nuclear-style indiscriminate destruction. They borrow from the design of the HEAT warheads on our old Avalanche missiles, focusing the explosion into a jet of high-velocity particles designed to pierce armoured UFO hulls. &#10; &#10;To generate this effect, both weapons are fitted with a dense tungsten cone that sits just in front of the warhead. When detonation occurs, the cone is immediately vaporised and the resulting spear of tungsten particles are propelled forwards at hypersonic speeds. This bombardment is capable of causing significant damage by itself, but it also fractures the heat-resistant outermost layer of the armour and leaves the UFO more vulnerable to the immense heat generated by the fusion reaction occurring in the warhead. An extremely effective design, if I say so myself.</desc>
<cdesc>想要增强一个核聚变武器的杀伤力相对来说比较简单，这使得制造一个供拦截机使用的空对空聚变导弹异常容易。在我们谈话的时候他们已经开始将飞行器的弹药装备升级为最新设计的聚变导弹和聚变鱼雷了。&#10;&#10;这些聚变武器能比之前的等离子武器制造更多的伤害，而且使用方式依然不变。核弹头的当量比我们所能制造的最大的聚变弹头当量要小一些(导弹大约500吨，鱼雷大约2000吨)，因为我们没有将其设计为像传统核武器那样无差别杀伤。它们借鉴了旧式的雪崩鱼雷的高热穿甲设计，将爆炸集中在一点，用释放出来的能量高速喷射微粒射穿UFO的船体装甲。&#10; &#10;为了实现这个效果，两种弹头都在头部装备了高密度的钨芯锥。在引爆时，椎体会瞬间升华，钨颗粒会像长矛一样以音速喷出。钨颗粒的轰击不但能造成显著的破坏，而且在破坏UFO船体的隔热层后，核聚变的高温还能继续肆无忌惮地破坏飞船内部。一个极端有效的设计，如果要我自己说的话。</cdesc>
