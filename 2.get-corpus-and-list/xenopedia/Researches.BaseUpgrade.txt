<desc>Having covered our scientific exploits in unlocking the secrets of the alien base in my last report, this covers the resulting improvements to our own facilities. The greatest improvements have been seen in our Laboratories and Workshops - both structures now allow scientists or engineers to work almost 50% more efficiently than before. Our new biological computers and instruments mean that my team are no longer entirely reliant on our own (ample) brainpower and have been able to fully automate several formerly time-consuming tasks, giving us more time to think. I have also had our upgraded laboratories soundproofed, allowing the brilliant minds among us to work without being disturbed by the less brilliant.&#10;&#10;There have also been a number of less obvious improvements to our base - e.g. the refit of base kitchens with laser-based ovens capable of cooking food in mere seconds, or the upgraded recreational areas with holographic entertainment consoles. Both of these have proved immensely popular, but unfortunately the replacement of the showers in the Living Quarters with (vastly-superior) alien gel sacs proved less popular. Events culminated in an incident with some of your soldiers, leading to the upgrade being postponed for now...but I hope you will discipline your men accordingly.&#10;&#10;Finally, we have developed an internal network that links all of our systems together, whether the same facility or not. This morning we were able to transmit a mildly amusing image of a cat halfway across the world, suggesting it will be an excellent tool for sharing classified information within our organisation. I named this impressive creation the &quot;internetwork&quot;, and would be very surprised if it did not catch on.</desc>
<cdesc>解开外星基地秘密的科学成果都已经被如实记录在我的上一份报告中，它包括对我们基地设施的一次全面改良，最主要的改进体现在科研和工程设施 - 现在我们的科学家和工程师的工作效率相比之前大约提高了50%。新的生物质计算机和科研器材能够自动处理一些耗时的工作，让我的团队不必再浪费宝贵(尽管充裕)的脑力；我还顺便改良了实验室的隔音效果，让我们中最聪明的头脑不必再受到次聪明的人的打扰。&#10;&#10;此外还有几个不是那么显眼的改进 - 比如，基地的食堂换上了能在几秒内煮熟食物的激光灶台，休息区装上了全息娱乐设备，这两项改进都已被证实极受欢迎。不幸的是，将居住区的淋浴喷头替换成(上等的)外星凝胶液囊明显不受欢迎，抗议最终在你的一些士兵当中升级成了一场骚乱，导致其余的升级被无限推迟至今... 但我希望你借此好好管理一下你的人。&#10;&#10;最后，我们开发出了一种将我们所有的系统链接在一起的内部网络，无论它们是不是在同一个设施内。今天早晨我们成功将一张滑稽的猫咪照片传输到了地球的另一头，它会成为我们组织内部共享机密情报的最佳工具。我将这个引人瞩目的发明命名为&quot;互联网&quot;，很难想象将来它流行不起来。</cdesc>
