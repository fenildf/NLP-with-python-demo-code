<desc>We have been studying captured alien plasma weapons from the very start of the war, but have always lacked enough understanding of the technology to weaponise it effectively. However in recent times we have come close enough that we can bridge the gap using the favoured technique of the intellectually deficient: imitation. This has allowed us to build a functioning copy of the graviton emitter that had stymied our progress up to this point. &#10;&#10;Given our detailed understanding of the plasma accelerator that converts the energy into a plasma bolt and the electromagnet spiral that shapes the bolt, we were able to use trial and error until we stumbled onto a working configuration of the three components. Small adjustments to the relative scale and distance between these three components allows us to generate plasma bolts with subtly different properties, thus producing different weapons. These plasma weapons are a straightforward upgrade for our existing laser weapons, inflicting heavier damage whilst maintaining similar range and accuracy. In most other respects, they behave much like their predecessors.&#10;&#10;Finally, I discovered recently that the Nobel Prize panel does not disqualify submissions if the scientific advances in question have been stolen from extraterrestrials rather than humans. I estimate I am now owed at least six of them and would greatly appreciate it if you could use these new Plasma weapons to keep Stockholm safe until the end of the war.</desc>
