<desc>One of your engineers recently presented me with an idea for a rapid-fire laser weapon. Though it is (predictably) expressed crudely, the fundamental science appears sound.&#10;&#10;The ideal approach would be to generate a continuous beam of energy that can be &quot;swept&quot; across the battlefield, but even alien superconductors are not capable of dissipating the amount of heat generated by sustained continuous fire. The proposed solution borrows heavily from the Autocannon mounted on our interceptors - multiple rotating barrels. Instead of using a rotating barrel arrangement to facilitate high-speed loading of ammunition, it can be used to vastly reduce the amount of heat continual fire will generate in each individual barrel. We have successfully tested two three-barrel prototype weapons in our laboratories.&#10;&#10;The Scatter Laser is a rapid-fire infantry weapon designed to replace the ballistic Machinegun. It inflicts increased damage and suppression, at the cost of reduced ammunition capacity. Unfortunately, it still suffers &quot;recoil&quot; (albeit in this case caused by the spinning of the heavy cooling arrays rather than the recoil of the projectiles) and therefore will require a strong soldier to achieve full accuracy with this weapon.&#10;&#10;The Gatling Laser is scaled up to fit the cannon hardpoint on our interceptors, using a triangular arrangement of three powerful lasers that collectively inflict much greater damage than the conventional Autocannon. The increased size and weight of the weapon allows us to use mostly conventional materials in the construction of the weapon and its power cell, paradoxically making them far easier and faster to manufacture than their smaller cousins. As such, we have already upgraded our existing Autocannons to the new design - the only difference you should see is increased combat effectiveness.</desc>
