<desc>Studying alien electronics taught us much about how to create them, but we also learned how to destroy them. This was largely accidental - my team destroyed alien electrical systems on several occasions by running an overly large current through them, while your engineers helpfully demonstrated that they were also vulnerable to being dropped on the floor. Though I was not particularly amused at the time, the knowledge gained eventually proved useful.&#10;&#10;I present you with the Electroshock Grenade. It generates a powerful electromagnetic discharge on detonation, inflicting major EMP damage on any mechanical unit caught in the blast and stun damage on biological ones (as there is no explosive component in the device the terrain will remain completely unaffected). The stunning effect of the grenade is not quite as powerful as that generated by a stun baton, but this is offset by the greater range. This will be of great relief to your men: I have noted the soldiers assigned to capture duty (&quot;shock-jocks&quot;) appear to have significantly lower morale than the others.&#10;&#10;The Electroshock Grenade is also very useful for destroying robotic enemy units. The EMP pulse completely bypasses the target's armour and overloads the electronic systems underneath. The actual damage inflicted is only average at best, but could still prove very useful against well-protected extraterrestrial drones and robots that are difficult to damage through conventional means.</desc>
<cdesc>对外星电子器件的研究不止让我们学会了如何制造它们，也学会了如何摧毁它们。这主要是出于以外 - 我的团队好几次因为在外星电子系统上加了过量的电流而烧毁了它们，此外你的工程师们也用行动证明了那些电路可以被通过摔到地板上来破坏。不过我当时还是没有笑出来，知识终归是有用的。&#10;&#10;我现在向你展示的是电击手雷。在引爆时它会制造强力的电磁场，对杀伤范围内的所有机械单位造成严重的电磁脉冲伤害，对活体生物则造成击晕伤害(由于装置中没有爆炸物成分，引爆时不会对周围环境造成破坏)。尽管对生物的击晕效果不如电棍，但这个缺点可以被它的范围效果弥补。这对你的人来说是个极大的欣慰:我注意到那些被分配执行抓捕任务的士兵(俗称&quot;电棍手&quot;)表现的明显比其他人士气要低落。&#10;&#10;电击手雷同样可用来摧毁敌人的机器人部队。电磁脉冲会绕过它们的装甲直接超载破坏内部电路。尽管很难做到一击毙命，但它在对付拥有厚重装甲的地外无人机和机器人时仍比传统方法更为有效。</cdesc>
