<desc>The MAG Railgun is the most powerful weapon we could conceivably mount on a vehicle, firing sizeable explosive pellets at hypersonic speeds. It is also an excellent defence battery weapon, the only ground weapon we have that is capable of breaching the thick armour of an alien capital ship.&#10;&#10;The MAG Railgun is a railgun rather than a coilgun. Rather than using a coil of magnets to accelerate the projectile, it instead uses a parallel pair of oppositely-charged electromagnetic rails. These are linked by the projectile itself, which effectively completes the electrical circuit between the two rails. The resulting magnetic force pushes the projectile along the rails and launches it from the end of the gun barrel at high speed. The railgun design is more complex in practice than the coilgun, but is more efficient and can generate much greater projectile velocities.&#10;&#10;Our prototype is extremely powerful and can impart enough kinetic energy into a projectile to launch it clean into orbit...although the air resistance means there would not be a great deal of it left afterwards. Nevertheless, this makes the Railgun a rather handy battlefield tool. It is capable of annihilating most targets with a single shot, whilst also inflicting heavy explosive damage on anything nearby. We have already fitted enlarged versions of these weapons on our existing defence batteries, making them significantly more effective. In a sense, it is a pity that Earth possesses an atmosphere: if it did not burn up our projectiles as they travelled through it, we could simply blast the alien UFOs out of orbit. </desc>
