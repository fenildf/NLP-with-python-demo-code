<desc>The radar screens are silent. The death of the High Praetor has reduced the aliens held in our labs to a catatonic state; even our captured Praetor is utterly unresponsive. It seems the war is finally over.&#10;&#10;Humanity is rightly celebrating our victory – the sacrifices made by the brave men and women of our organisation will echo through the ages. Though nobody has done more than I to ensure the survival of the human race, I have little doubt your name will be written into history just below my own. This does not mean our mission is over: the world will not simply return to how it was before the invasion began. It is inevitable that our new technology will drastically alter the balance of world power; even one of our singularity cores produces sufficient energy to supply the entire planet for centuries. &#10;&#10;The squabbling has already begun. Some are already lobbying for our organisation to be placed under Soviet or American oversight. This technology could be used for the benefit of all humanity, irrespective of race or creed. Our backers instead seek to turn my inventions to their own narrow ends. But who better to decide the shape of our new world than those who saved it? We have bargaining chips of our own: direct control of both the cores themselves and the most sophisticated military force on the planet. I could annihilate the entire planet in the blink of an eye if I so chose. Are they really in a position to dictate to us?&#10;&#10;The Xenonauts were established to protect humanity, Commander.  You did exceptional work to protect us from the extraterrestrial menace; you must now plot a path that protects us from ourselves.</desc>
<cdesc>雷达屏幕归于沉寂。至高执政官的死使那些被关在我们实验室里的外星生物几近崩溃，甚至是已被我们俘虏的执政官也变得毫无反应。所有的一切都意味着战争似乎终于落下了帷幕。&#10;&#10;人类开始欢庆胜利——我们组织中那些勇士的牺牲将回荡在历史的长河中。尽管在这场拯救人类的战争中我的贡献无人可比，我仍确信你们的名字将随我之后被载入史册。但这并不意味着我们的任务已然结束：世界已无法简简单单的恢复到入侵前的模样。显而易见的是，我们全新的科技将彻底打破世界力量的平衡；仅一颗奇点核心就足以提供维持这颗星球运转数百年的能量。 &#10;&#10;争端已然显露。一些人正在游说，意图将我们组织至于苏联或美国的监管之下。这项科技本可以造福全人类，不论种族或信仰。而我们的投资者却因一己私欲企图夺取我的发明。可是，还有谁能比那些拯救了这个世界的人更能塑造一个崭新的世界呢？我们手握谈判的筹码：奇点核心和这个星球最富战斗力的军队都在我们的直接掌控之下。如果我愿意，便能在眨眼间毁灭整个星球。难道他们真的还以为可以继续通过权势迫使我们屈从吗？&#10;&#10;Xenonauts已经完成了保护人类的使命，长官。你超乎想象的在外星生物威胁中保护我们幸免于难；现在，是时候从人类内部暗涌的危机中探寻救赎之路了。</cdesc>
