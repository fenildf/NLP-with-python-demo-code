<desc>The Landing Ship is a medium-size alien craft with an unusually large crew - though bulkier and more powerful than the Corvette, this saucer-shaped craft is actually primarily a transport vessel. &#10;&#10;The saucer is split into a bridge on the upper level and a cargo hold on the level below, comfortably large enough to accommodate a terror squad or even the equipment we believe would be required to establish a permanent alien facility on the surface of our planet. These two rooms are joined by a pair of teleportation devices that instantaneously transport any unit that steps onto one of the platforms over to the other. Despite studying them extensively, we still have no idea at all how these devices function. &#10;&#10;Almost as interesting is the armour plating on the exterior of the ship. It requires immense firepower to crack one of these vessels open, which we assumed was due to more extensive armour plating - but, troublingly, the Landing Ship actually has much less armour plate than the Corvette. We have taken samples of this hardened plate for further study. The vessel's primary weapon is just a scaled up version of the cannon on the Corvette, but it also possesses a smaller rapid-fire secondary weapon that packs sufficient punch to make a frontal approach inadvisable.</desc>
<cdesc>登陆舰是一艘中型的外星飞行器，它有着特别多的乘员——尽管体型更庞大火力也比护卫舰更猛烈，这飞行器却主要是用来作为运载工具。&#10;&#10;飞行器的上部呈桥状，而下部则是一个货物承载区域，这足以轻易的容纳一队战术小队或者运载那些能够在地球表面建造外星设施的设备。这两个区域由灵能装置连接在一起，可以瞬间将单位传送到另一端。尽管我们对其进行了深入的研究，却依旧不知道其运作原理。&#10;&#10;飞船的外部装甲也非常的有意思，我们用了极大火力才打开舱门，以为是装甲太厚了——结果，出乎我们的意料，登陆舰的护甲比护卫舰薄多了。我们取了一些强化护甲的样本做深入研究。登陆舰的武器只有一门强化过的护卫舰主炮，只是它那能频繁开火的副炮，让正面接近它变得很愚蠢。</cdesc>
