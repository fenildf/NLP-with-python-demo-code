<desc>Our foes are numberless. No matter how brave our soldiers or how skilled our pilots, we cannot hold their fleets at bay forever...but we may not have to. The aliens have miscalculated: even the fastest alien ship can only reach a tenth of lightspeed using conventional propulsion, leaving them reliant on hyperspace technology for interstellar travel. &#10;&#10;We already have a fully functional hyperspace inhibitor in our laboratory. The principle behind it is derived from radio jamming - it generates vast amounts of randomised &quot;noise&quot; that causes a destabilising cascade in any nearby hyperspace tunnel, causing it to collapse on itself before any travel can occur. It should inhibit all hyperspace travel for a thousand light years around our planet, preventing the arrival of any alien reinforcements.&#10;&#10;However, activating the device now would be suicide. The alien fleet in orbit are hardly likely to maintain the charade of invasion once the disruptor comes online. Indeed, there is a failsafe for this exact scenario: the alien Dreadnought carries enough Reapers to eradicate all life on the planet. If unleashed on a population centre, there would be tens of millions of the creatures within hours. Once they had overwhelmed humanity, the Praetors could gather up the Reapers and pick through the absorbed genetic material at their leisure. A depressingly neat solution.&#10;&#10;But even this would give us a small window of opportunity. A single strike team could land on the Dreadnought as it descends into our atmosphere. If they can find and kill the High Praetor before the Reapers are unleashed on our planet, the alien fleet would be left leaderless and defeated, their reinforcements stranded thousands of years away. But if your men were to fail, the entire human race would die with them.&#10;&#10;This mission is &quot;Operation Endgame&quot;. We can launch it whenever you wish, Commander; all we have to do is switch on the hyperspace disruptor.</desc>
