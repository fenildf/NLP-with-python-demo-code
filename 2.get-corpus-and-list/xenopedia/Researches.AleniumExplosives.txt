<desc>The majority of Alenium found inside wrecked UFOs has been run through the vessel's reactor, making it of little use as a fuel. This low-grade Alenium only contains enough power to run an extraterrestrial device for a few minutes, whereas fresh Alenium can do so for hours at a time. However, it turns out there is another use for this relatively abundant low-grade Alenium: explosives.&#10;&#10;The amount of energy held in depleted Alenium is usually still appreciably higher than is contained in the equivalent weight of TNT. My team has therefore been able to produce improved designs for the high-explosive rockets and grenades issues to our soldiers, replacing the explosives with an Alenium charge that is up to 50% more powerful than conventional munitions. Given the ample availability of the constituent parts, these can be manufactured and issued to our soldiers in effectively unlimited numbers.  Your men seem impressed; they spent so long testing the new devices that the firing range required structural repairs.&#10;&#10;The principle behind these devices is simple: the &quot;explosive&quot; is a block of Alenium that dumps all of its energy into the surrounding air when triggered. The warhead on the rocket is sufficiently large that this will generate a sizeable explosion, but the grenade also employs a steel casing that fragments into a deadly cloud of metal shards on detonation. However, be aware that these weapons will inflict as much damage on extraterrestrial equipment as on the aliens themselves - aliens killed with explosives are unlikely to leave a corpse behind, let alone recoverable items.</desc>
<cdesc>从被摧毁的 UFO 中得到的 Alenium，大多数作为燃料，已经在飞船引擎的反应堆中被使用过。这类 Alenium 无法再次作为燃料使用。这种低等的 Alenium 中蕴含的能量，只能让外星装备运行几分钟而已。而等量全新的 Alenium 能够支持外星装备连续运行几个小时。然而，这种几乎应该被丢弃的低等 Alenium 却有另外一个用途：炸药。这种废弃的 Alenium 中蕴含的能量依旧明显高于等量的TNT炸药。因此，我的团队能够为士兵们设计更优质的高爆火箭弹和手榴弹。通过将原来的炸药填充物更换为低等 Alenium ，这些武器的威力最多可提升50%。这些武器的原材料非常丰富，可以进行大规模生产。因而可以为我们的士兵们提供几乎无限量的武器供应。士兵们对新武器非常着迷，他们花费了太多时间在测试新装备上，以至于在他们火力范围内的区域都需要彻底维修一下了。这些武器背后的原理很简单：“爆炸”。一块低等的 Alenium 将其全部剩余能量释放到它周围的空间中。高爆火箭弹的弹头足够大，所以能够直接依靠爆炸的威力摧毁敌人。但高爆手雷依然需要通过爆炸的力量，将其金属外壳化为一片致命的碎片风暴来杀伤敌人。值得注意的是，这些新武器对外星敌人和他们身上的装备都会造成同等的伤害 -- 被 Alenium 炸药杀死的外星敌人很难留有全尸，更不用说那些装备了。</cdesc>
