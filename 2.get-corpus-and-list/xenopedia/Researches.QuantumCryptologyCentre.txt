<desc>The Quantum Cryptology Centre is a new structure that can be constructed in our bases, allowing us to decrypt the communications emanating from alien craft that have been detected by the base's radar arrays. This will give us full details of the UFO class, mission and crew.&#10;&#10;The decryption algorithm developed by my team when studying the alien Communication Array has been used to produce listening devices that can capture and decode alien transmissions in real-time. All that they require is the position of the UFO that they will be tracking, provided by the radar tracking systems already in place at your bases. The Cryptology Centre uses a scaling supercomputer architecture that can track unlimited numbers of UFOs; tracking numerous signals simultaneously will draw additional power and may lead to temporary power cuts in non-essential areas (e.g. leisure facilities, engineering department) but important base structures such as the command room and laboratories will remain unaffected.&#10;&#10;The design of the listening devices is based on the old Cray supercomputers, but is several orders of magnitude more powerful. The level of encryption on alien signals is so great that even with access to the decryption key it still requires a vast amount of computing power to decode the message. An entirely new generation of specialised quantum computing hardware needed to be designed to perform these calculations; thankfully I rose to the challenge. This structure should prove extremely useful for co-ordinating our air defence and appropriately equipping your troops prior to battle.</desc>
