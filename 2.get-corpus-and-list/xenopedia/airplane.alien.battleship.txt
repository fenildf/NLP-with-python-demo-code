<desc>The Battleship is an enormous alien UFO with a crew of elite alien soldiers. We believe it represents the largest UFO class in the alien fleet, matching the largest orbital signals we have been tracking almost exactly.&#10;&#10;It is a monstrous creation. Where other UFOs had armour barely an inch thick, this behemoth has a foot of hardened plating on its outer shell and is virtually impervious to conventional weapons. It can cleave through the air at the best part of three thousand kilometers an hour, despite weighing over a thousand tons, and possesses a fearsome long-range beam weapon that will carve apart buildings and ground targets as easily as it does our interceptors.&#10;&#10;The only conceivable way a vessel could be capable of any of these things, let alone all of them, is by utilising a power source an order of magnitude more powerful than anything yet seen. Make every effort to recover it intact, as we will be encountering these monsters in our skies with increasing frequency. Given the sheer firepower needed to bring down even one, we will either need to develop something capable of countering them or build more interceptors. A lot more.</desc>
<cdesc>战列舰是一艘搭载了大量外星精英士兵的巨型UFO。我们认为这是UFO舰队里最大的单位，它的轨道信号与我们曾经追踪的完全一致。&#10;&#10;它真是怪物一般的存在。其他的UFO只有数英寸厚的护甲，然而这家伙有一英尺厚的强化护甲并且传统武器对它毫无效果。尽管它有几千吨的重量，但依旧能以每小时3千公里的时速划过空中，还有他那可怕的远程光束武器，能轻易的切开建筑和地面单位，对付我们的拦截机也是轻而易举。&#10;&#10;为了对抗这东西，唯一能想到的就是利用能量制造出前所未见的强大武器。由于日后会在天空中与这些怪物更多的交战，我们要尽全力填充这武器并保证它随时待命。要使尽浑身解数，哪怕只能打下来一艘，我们也能研究出更适合对付他们的方法或者建造更多的拦截机。而这只是个开始。</cdesc>
