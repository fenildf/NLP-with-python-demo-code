<desc>Basic Armour is standard-issue equipment for our strike teams. It does not offer much in the way of protection, but does not encumber the wearer in any way nor reduce his situational awareness.&#10;&#10;It has been designed primarily for function; providing the soldier protection from the elements and enough carrying space to hold all of his equipment. The only concession to protective equipment is the steel helmet, which offers a measure of protection against shrapnel or other flying debris. We know little about extraterrestrial weapons at this point in time, so there is little point in slowing our men down with protective equipment that may well have no effect at all. A few of your men have remarked on the visibility of the fetching blue used, too - it is highly unlikely that the aliens see in the same visual spectrum as we do, so camouflage is likely wasted effort. Better our men know exactly where their comrades are at all times.&#10;&#10;We should be able to design protective equipment tailored to defend against alien weapons once we have captured and studied a few examples. In the meantime, the men will be relying on your tactical abilities to keep them out of harm's way.</desc>
<cdesc>基础护甲是我们突击小队的基本装备。它不对穿戴者提供太多的保护，但也不会造成任何妨碍，或是降低他的环境感知能力。&#10;&#10;基础护甲主要被设计用来完成特定功能; 向士兵提供对元素的防御功能，并提供足够的空间用以携带所有装备。唯一提供防护功能的装备是钢盔，它能使穿戴者免受流弹或是其它飞行碎片的侵害。我们目前对外星武器知之甚少，所以没有理由让那些不知道有没有实际效果的防护装备来拖慢士兵们的移动速度。你们中的有些人也讨论过深蓝的可见性。但是外星人的可见光谱很可能和我们不一样，所以迷彩伪装恐怕只是徒劳。我们最好能时刻掌握它们的位置。只要我们能够缴获几例外星武器并进行研究，应该就能设计出足以抵御外星武器的防护装备。同时，我们将仰仗于你们的战术能力以免受外星人的伤害。</cdesc>
