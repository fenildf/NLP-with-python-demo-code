<desc>We have developed a grenade that disperses a deadly chemical agent across the blast radius on detonation. This chemical agent is highly toxic to both alien and human units and even short-term exposure may cause debilitating injury or death. It has been developed to attack the two important biological pathways identified in our work on Alien Biology to be shared by all extraterrestrial species - their circulatory and nervous systems. The agent contains numerous compounds that interfere with one or both of these, divisible into nerve agents or blood agents.&#10;&#10;Nerve agents attack the extraterrestrial nervous system by interfering with the operation of nerve synapses, stifling the breakdown of the neurotransmitter that causes muscles to contract. Exposure leaves the victim unable to relax its muscles, initially causing convulsions and then asphyxiation as the respiratory system goes into spasm shuts down. Blood agents are little better; once absorbed into the blood they will attack the systems of oxygen transmission. The more pleasant compounds will simply bind permanently with the oxygen-carrying proteins in alien blood, sealing them off so they can no longer carry oxygen. Others will destroy the blood cells entirely, or attack the walls of blood vessels to cause major internal bleeding. This also results in respiratory failure.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, these toxins are almost as effective on humans as they are on extraterrestrials, so any soldiers or civilians who inhale the chemical gas will rapidly be overcome. However, I draw your attention to the fact that these compounds are all absorbed via exposed skin or through inhalation. Advanced armour (whether human or extraterrestrial) that incorporates a rebreather or covers a large area of skin will dramatically reduce the damage that the toxins will inflict on the wearer.&#10;&#10;Mass-production of these toxins has not proved difficult even with only conventional human technology, so Toxin Grenades have been made available to our troops in unlimited quantities.</desc>
