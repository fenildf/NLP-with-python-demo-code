<desc>The Praetor is a frail, withered creature standing 180 cm (5 foot 10 inches) tall...well, I say &quot;standing&quot;, but field reports suggest this creature is an exceptionally powerful psionic entity capable of levitating itself through the air using only the power of thought. Tissue analysis suggests these creatures are tens of millions of years older than any of the other alien species we have encountered; they are almost certainly the extraterrestrial command caste.&#10;&#10;The white armour these creatures wear is lightweight and presumably largely ceremonial in nature, offering little actual protection. The body beneath is underdeveloped, with a brittle skeleton and internal organs that are barely functional - indeed the creature's circulatory system is synthetic, driven by a powerful &quot;heart&quot; implanted between the shoulder blades. This supplies nutrients to the alien's prodigious brain, which is almost twice the size of the human equivalent and contains several extremely complex structures packed with respiratory cells that metabolise Alenium nanoparticles from the bloodstream. This would produce vast amounts of energy; we assume it is this that allows them to manifest their psionic abilities.&#10;&#10;This has powerful implications. These creatures have clearly surpassed the limits of their biology, engineering their brains and bodies to gain immense psionic powers. They long since passed the point where they can sustain themselves without their technology; even at rest their brains consume more energy than is generated by the average nuclear power plant.  Only regular infusions of Alenium nanoparticles can stave off fatal brain starvation. Has their machinery released them, or imprisoned them? Both, perhaps.&#10;&#10;Anyway, it goes without saying that the psionic strength of these creatures makes them extremely dangerous on the battlefield. You should also expect them to be difficult to kill, as I strongly suspect that their psionic powers grant them far more protection than conventional armour ever would.</desc>
