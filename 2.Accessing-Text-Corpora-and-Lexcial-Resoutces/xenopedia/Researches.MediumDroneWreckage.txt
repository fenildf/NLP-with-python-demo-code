<desc>The Medium Drone is a battlefield drone roughly two metres in diameter. It is the closest thing yet encountered to an alien attack vehicle, possessing heavy armour and a powerful, fast-firing main cannon that is significantly more dangerous than alien infantry weapons.&#10;&#10;The Medium Drone is best thought of as a miniaturised UFO. We believe the inch-thick armoured shell is fabricated from the same lightweight but durable materials as used in the fighter-class UFOs, predictably far more effective against infantry weapons than the powerful missiles and cannons. There are also striking similarities in terms of flight control circuitry and weapon array that suggest a common ancestor. Other elements appear to have been drawn from the Light Drone, such as the powerful frontal scanner and central Alenium reactor - though naturally both of these have also been significantly enlarged.&#10;&#10;The formidable weapon system is worth mentioning for two reasons. Firstly, it generates large amounts of highly-charged plasma and is capable of firing multiple shots in quick succession. Each of these is a powerful explosive in its own right, capable of killing or seriously injuring an armoured soldier. The second reason is that the array stores excess power from the drone's reactor and subsequently uses it to boost rate of fire. This system works perfectly well until the drone is destroyed, at which point any excess energy would be released in the form of a secondary explosion capable of killing or injuring anything nearby. </desc>
