<desc>This is it, Commander - the power source that underpins the entire extraterrestrial empire. A naked singularity captured in a delicate particle field, streaming raw energy in monumental quantities. The ball of energy at the core of the device is less than a foot wide and could power our entire civilisation for decades.&#10;&#10;The singularity within the device appears to forever exist on the point of collapse, stabilised by the particle field around it. It is a naked singularity, what I believe is the final state of a black hole - a final explosion that releases all of the energy accumulated by the black hole across its lifetime. The extraterrestrials must have found a method of &quot;capturing&quot; black holes and artificially inducing this explosive state. Once this has been done, the particle field is used to &quot;freeze&quot; the singularity mid-explosion.&#10;&#10;This forms an elegant closed system. The particle field captures the vast quantities of energy emitted by the singularity, siphoning off a small amount to maintain the field and feeding the excess back into the singularity (which promptly re-emits it). The enormous amount of power flowing endlessly through the loop can then be tapped as required by anything connected to the Singularity Core. As each singularity contains a finite supply of energy, the energy flowing through the circuit will eventually fall to zero - at which point both the particle field and singularity collapse and disappear entirely.&#10;&#10;The Singularity Core represents the solution to every power consumption issue we have ever had. Alenium reactors can only be miniaturised so far, but the Singularity Core provides almost limitless amounts of power and the containment field can be made small enough to fit inside virtually anything we can dream up. Only one complication - as we obviously do not possess the capacity to harvest singularities ourselves, we will need to capture these devices from the extraterrestrials if we want to use them.</desc>
