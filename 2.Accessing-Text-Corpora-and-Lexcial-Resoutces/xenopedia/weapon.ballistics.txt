<desc>Our ballistic weapons are conventional firearms, provided in unlimited quantities by our backers. We have four main classes of normal weapon (heavy weapons will be discussed separately), and I will provide a brief summary of the strengths and weaknesses of each below:&#10;&#10;The Pistol is a single-handed weapon with a short range and relatively low damage, but one that can be fired very quickly. It is a perfectly capable weapon at close ranges, but is primarily useful as a sidearm (e.g. for snipers) or when the soldier has something else in their other hand (e.g. a grenade or a combat shield). Also, please note that absolutely no combat advantage is gained by dual-wielding these weapons. It is simply childish.&#10;&#10;The Shotgun fires shells that break into several shots, making it most effective when the spread is small and all of the shot strikes a single target. It can be fired relatively quickly and does considerable damage at short-range, but it is completely ineffective at long range. It is best used as a breaching weapon and for close-quarter work, where it can bring down hostile units faster than our other weapons.&#10;&#10;The Assault Rifle is the most versatile of our weapons, accurate at all ranges and capable of burst fire. It cannot be fired as quickly as the Pistol / Shotgun and it does not do as much damage as other weapons, but it is useful in practically any situation. It is always worth having a backbone of rifle-armed troops on combat missions.&#10;&#10;The Precision Rifle is a marksman's rifle. It does additional damage per shot than the Rifle and is more accurate, but takes additional time to aim and cannot use burst fire. It is not a very efficient weapon at short range, but it is king where there are large open spaces and good sight lines.</desc>
<cdesc>弹道武器是最方便的轻兵器，可以不限量使用。我们有四种常规武器（重型武器特殊讨论）。每种武器的优点和弱点总结如下：&#10;&#10;手枪是一种单手持武器，射程短，伤害低，但是开火速度很快。近距离作战时，这是一种强有力的武器，但多数情况下，手枪主要用作副武器（例如，狙击手副武器）或者在士兵手持其他单手武器（例如，手榴弹或者防爆盾）时使用。注意：装备两把手枪在作战时不会有额外效益。&#10;&#10;散弹枪在射击之后，子弹会爆炸成碎片，每一片都会作为新的子弹攻击目标。散弹枪开火速度快，近距离内杀伤力大，但远距离下威力很小。散弹枪在近距离作战时可以比其他武器更快地放倒敌人，所以最好将其用于近距离突破防线。&#10;&#10;突击步枪是武器中的多面手，能适应所有作战距离，可以连发。虽然开火速度没有手枪、散弹枪迅速，火力也不如某些武器强，但是它可以对各种作战环境的适应能力极强。所以在战斗任务中装备突击步枪是不错的选择。&#10;&#10;狙击步枪是神射手的专用步枪。它比突击步枪的威力更大，精准度更高，但是需要的瞄准时间更多，而且不能连发。短距离作战表现不好，但是在地域空旷，视野好的情况下，它就是王者。</cdesc>
