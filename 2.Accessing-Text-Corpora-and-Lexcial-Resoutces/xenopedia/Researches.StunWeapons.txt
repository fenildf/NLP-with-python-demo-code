<desc>Studying extraterrestrial biology has allowed our scientists to devise methods of incapacitating our enemies for interrogation and further study. There appears to be three main possible avenues of attack, all of which are equally effective against humans as they are against aliens: &#10;&#10;The first is simple concussive force applied to the victim's brain or nervous system, either via physical impact or the shockwave from an explosion. This method is both crude and unreliable (particularly against tougher alien species such as Sebillians), but you may find it occurs unexpectedly on the battlefield. The second is oxygen starvation, where higher brain functions shut down due to lack of oxygen. This can happen incidentally via smoke inhalation, or can be induced via a &quot;stun gas&quot; that temporarily binds with the victim's blood and prevents it from carrying oxygen around the body, generating a powerful disabling effect without ultimately being fatal if sufficient amounts are inhaled. &#10;&#10;The final method of incapacitation is an electrical current delivered at a sufficiently high voltage, which will utterly disrupt the nervous system of the victim and render them unconscious. This is extremely effective, but highly dangerous - an electrical discharge of the required voltage can only be delivered with a melee weapon. My team have therefore designed a shock baton that can be used to subdue enemies at close range and grenades / rockets that can be used to deliver stun gas from a distance. Whatever method you choose to employ, any captive alien would be an extremely valuable research subject.</desc>
