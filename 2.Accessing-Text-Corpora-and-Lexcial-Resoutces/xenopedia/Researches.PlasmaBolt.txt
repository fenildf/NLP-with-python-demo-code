<desc>The Plasma Bolt is a heavy plasma weapon that fires explosive plasma projectiles that inflict severe damage on the target and anything else caught in the blast. It has been used to upgrade our base defence batteries, but can also be mounted on our combat vehicles.&#10;&#10;The weapon uses an enhanced version of the plasma generation system used in our infantry plasma weapons, making full use of the space available in a vehicle turret. Every important component has been scaled up to improve the overall power of the weapon, though not all have been resized equally - e.g. we have fitted a disproportionately large Alenium power cell, which boosts the damage of the weapon but also increases ammunition capacity. The resulting projectile is almost twice as large as the one produced by the infantry Plasma Rifle and his far better damage and armour penetration.&#10;&#10;It is also a useful point-defence weapon for our facilities. The bolt is powerful enough to inflict damage on a target several kilometers away and we have performed additional work on spinning the projectile to prevent it veering badly off target over distance. The rotary force imparted by the helical electromagnets in the weapon is lost after only a hundred metres or so (making it worthless for anti-air battery fire), but we have discovered a second graviton generator can be used in tandem with the first to create a linked pair of gravitons that orbit one another. The entire projectile spins as they do so, allowing it to maintain a stable flight path for several kilometers.</desc>
