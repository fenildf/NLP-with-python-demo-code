<desc>The Singularity Torpedo is the most destructive weapon mankind has ever created. It produces a perfectly spherical release of energy that will instantly reduce anything within five kilometers to its constituent atoms (do not expect to recover anything from alien craft destroyed by this weapon). As it has been designed specifically for hypersonic launch, it may only be carried by our X-120 Fury interceptor. &#10;&#10;The destructive power of the weapon is drawn from the practically limitless energy held within a Singularity Core. The looping particle field that stabilises the singularity can be replicated and used as a method of storage, capturing energy when connected to the Core and releasing it when the loop is later broken. A charged loop can thus be used as the warhead on a torpedo, containing so much energy that it will utterly annihilate anything caught in the blast radius. It has actually been necessary to develop a method of using part of the discharge to generate a larger secondary field that artificially limits the size of the explosion - without it, there would be a small but statistically significant chance of the detonation destroying our entire planet.&#10;&#10;The rest of the torpedo is relatively straightforward design. The main propulsion unit employs a scramjet, which allows roughly thirty seconds of flight at speeds reaching Mach 15 (almost 20,000 km/h). This not only allows it to be launched by a Fury travelling at hypersonic speed, but actually necessitates it - a scramjet can only generate thrust when it is sucking in air travelling at Mach 4 or higher, a speed that our other interceptors cannot reach.</desc>
