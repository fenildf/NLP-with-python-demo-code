<desc>The average alien soldier is just an empty shell, possessing an instinctive knowledge of the craft of war but little higher brain function. There is a reason for this: alien Officers are highly intelligent, and do not lead their troops in battle so much as directly possess them. I would suggest that the word &quot;Officer&quot; is a misnomer; &quot;Controller&quot; would be more appropriate.&#10;&#10;The alien mindset is strange. We were already aware the same species and rank were identical clones, but it seems that these creatures actually consider themselves interchangeable. Not exactly a collective consciousness, more that they simply have no concept of &quot;self&quot;. Provided one of their clones survives, they would not consider themselves to be dead. This makes interrogation a struggle - not only is it difficult to threaten a creature which cannot grasp the concept of its own death, choosing the correct pronoun when asking a question becomes a minefield. Nonetheless, we managed to glean a little useful information: the captive confirmed the intention of the invasion was to kill humans individually, but not collectively. It seems they are not actually trying to wipe us out. &#10;&#10;In truth, this is nothing we did not already know. If the aliens wanted to annihilate us, they could simply have bombed us into extinction from orbit. The invasion evidently has a higher purpose, but we could not extract it from our captive. We will have to capture an alien Leader to learn more.</desc>
