<desc>The &quot;Jackal&quot; Combat Armour offers our soldiers extra battlefield protection at the cost of increased weight. It is not the ideal equipment for every situation, but in many cases the extra survivability could be the difference between life and death.&#10;&#10;Laboratory tests on captured alien plasma weapons have confirmed that traditional body armour is essentially worthless against energy projectiles, having been designed to resist ballistic impact rather than heat damage. However, testing a modified combat vest with heat-resistant rather than impact-resistant ceramic plates showed impressive results. The ceramics were able to dissipate enough of the heat to give the wearer a reasonable chance of survival, though they are still likely to suffer injuries in the process.&#10;&#10;While it provides an obvious boost to survivability, this armour is heavy and will limit the other equipment (such as ammunition or secondary weapons) a soldier can carry into battle. Armour also degrades rapidly under fire and will not withstand repeated hits, nor provide the wearer guaranteed protection - e.g. it hardly matters what armour a soldier is wearing if he is shot in the face. Nevertheless, it is still better than nothing and can be constructed in the workshop.</desc>
<cdesc>&quot;胡狼&quot;战斗护甲以提升重量为代价来提供对战士们在战场上的额外保护。在某些情形下，它并非最理想的装备。但是在许多情况下，这额外的生存能力将会决定生死。&#10;&#10; 对缴获到的外星等离子武器的实验室测试已经证实了传统的身体护甲对于能量弹来说几乎形同虚设。因为传统的护甲更多是为了抵御子弹冲击，而非热量伤害。然而，对于耐热而非耐冲击的陶瓷护甲的测试结果则相当惊人。陶瓷能够驱散足够的热量给使用者提供相当程度的生存率，尽管他们仍会受到一定的伤害。尽管陶瓷护甲确实能大幅增加生存能力，它的重量将会影响使用者携带其他装备（例如弹药或副武器）进入战场的能力。护甲在高热下会迅速老化并变得经受不起反复的冲击，也不能为使用者提供完全的保护。比如说一位战士的脸部被击中了，那无论他穿着怎样的护甲都没太大作用。但是，那也会比什么都不穿要好。这种护甲可以在车间里制造。</cdesc>
