<desc>Without the ability to communicate with our extraterrestrial attackers, there can be no peace. This war could only end with the extinction of one side - genocide on a galactic scale.&#10;&#10;It is therefore helpful that study of our captive has yielded the secret of alien communication. Extraterrestrials have atrophied vocal cords because they communicate via radio telepathy rather than verbally; an alien &quot;word&quot; is in fact just a short burst of radio waves. Energy-intensive, but effective. We have been able to construct a basic alien vocabulary by using our lab transceiver to record radio transmissions from our captive and repeating them back in various combinations. Study of the responses by our resident cryptographers deciphered the meanings of several, allowing us to conduct a basic conversation with our captive and expand our understanding still further. Though I care not for such trifles, our work here has created an entirely new scientific discipline - making me the father of xeno-linguistics.&#10;&#10;It is a shame that our captive proved such a terrible conversationalist, endlessly repeating a request for new orders and refusing to engage on any other subject. Interestingly, it seemed happy to thoughtlessly follow simple orders issued by my team (such as moving across its cell). Eventually, once it had become clear that no more could be gained from questioning the creature, one of my team handed it a pistol and ordered it to kill itself. It promptly complied, splattering its brains across half the containment tank. It seems the alien soldiers are just mindless thralls; I suppose we will need to capture an alien officer if we are to get the answers we seek. Oh, and before you get too excited: reproducing the &quot;suicide effect&quot; on the battlefield is completely impractical (it requires a stationary target and laboratory full of equipment).</desc>
