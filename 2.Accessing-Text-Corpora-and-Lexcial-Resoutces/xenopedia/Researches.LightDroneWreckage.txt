<desc>The Light Drone is a small saucer-shaped drone approximately 140cm wide, with a thruster array mounted on the rear of the saucer and the sensors and weaponry on the front. It is capable of hovering, but is usually sighted skimming the battlefield roughly a metre above the ground. This allows it to move freely over small obstacles or otherwise impassable terrain (such as water).&#10;&#10;Disassembly of recovered wreckage suggests that the heart of the drone is an Alenium reactor no larger than a man's fist.  We assume the mass of alien circuitry that surrounds it is, in fact, the drone's electronic brain. The lack of any visible receiver antennae suggests that these units are fully autonomous when operational. An engine array on the rear of drone provides forward motion, while the hover effect (and probably pitch and roll) is generated by the dozen small thrusters that dot the underside of the drone. The frontal part of the saucer is filled with a powerful scanner that can monitor almost the entire electromagnetic spectrum, giving these drones excellent sight ranges.&#10;&#10;The drone is armed with an unusual integrated weapon we have dubbed the &quot;burst cannon&quot;. The plasma generation array has been designed to emphasise rate of fire above all else, allowing it to fire extremely quickly but leaving it underpowered even compared to the Plasma Pistol - a single shot would probably not even kill an unarmoured civilian. As the shell of the drone itself is also not even thick enough to resist sustained small arms fire, I suspect these units are disposable scout units primarily designed to locate and suppress enemies so the accompanying aliens can deal with them more easily. A support role rather than a hunter-killer role, it seems.</desc>
