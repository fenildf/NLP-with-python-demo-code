<desc>A Caesan is a humanoid alien that stands approximately 170cm (5 feet 7 inches) tall. I imagine you share our surprise that they resemble humanity so closely; statistically we believe the likelihood of this occurring by chance is effectively zero.&#10;&#10;Caesans are physically weaker and less hardy than humans, with bone fractures occurring at only 60% of the force required to fracture human bone. Both are likely to be the result of prolonged exposure to a low-gravity environment. Their physiology is intriguingly similar to our own, with most internal organs present in a recognisable form and a remarkably similar skeletal structure. A couple of exceptions are worth noting: a substantially enlarged cranium contains a corresponding increase in brain tissue, and vocal cords are atrophied to the point where verbal communication would be impossible. The latter suggests the creatures have transcended words; perhaps they have a telepathic link with one another?&#10;&#10;The body shows extensive signs of genetic modification at the cellular level. Caesan tissue possess only a single sex chromosome and, more importantly, samples taken from multiple enemy combatants shows they are genetically identical - that is, they are all clones. Genitalia are present but heavily atrophied. Asexual reproduction is obviously at work, but almost certainly facilitated by some form of technology. A metal valve on the upper spine is linked to the creature's circulatory system, which may indicate an artificial method of blood filtration that replaces excretion. An undersized liver and kidneys suggest it is certainly possible. Indeed, if administered regularly, this blood filtration could also remove the need for consumption and digestion of foodstuffs entirely - nutrients could be fed directly into the blood serum. Has extraterrestrial technology surpassed their biology? Frankly, this corpse poses more questions than it answers.</desc>
