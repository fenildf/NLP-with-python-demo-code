<desc>A Harridan stands roughly 170cm (5 feet 7 inches) tall. They are mysterious foes, head and chest encased within an armoured shell and the rest of their body covered by a jumpsuit. They are delicate and slender in stature, with unusually long limbs. Armed with long-range weapons and a jetpack integrated into their armour, they almost certainly serve as the alien marksmen.&#10;&#10;The armour of this creature formed as much of the autopsy as the body itself, as we found much to suggest it was not designed to be removed. There is evidence of an advanced rebreather system in the helmet that, coupled with the jumpsuit, would allow the creature to operate in any environment up to a hard vacuum.  A blood filtration unit in the chest actually forms part of the Harridan circulatory system, pumping the blood around the body whilst filtering out excreta and other waste products. The helmet includes powerful cameras capable of viewing almost the entire electromagnetic spectrum, giving the alien long sight ranges and excellent situational awareness.&#10;&#10;The jump pack integrated into the rear of the armour is effectively a miniaturised version of the same thrusters used on UFOs. The control system is a neural network - i.e. plugged directly into the creature's brain. This almost certainly allows them to operate their thrusters (and probably receive sensor information) subconsciously. I believe these creatures are actually the alien engineer caste; they are completely unaffected by a vacuum and can maneuver around in space using their thrusters, allowing them to work on the exterior of a spaceborne UFO just as easily as the interior.&#10;&#10;The alien beneath the armour bears some resemblance to a Caesan, possessing the same pallid grey skin, oversize black eyes and frail bone structure. A common ancestor is likely, but they have diverged significantly since - clearest in the lengthened forearms, drooping ears and bony spurs on either side of the creature's mouth. However, the largest difference is cerebral. The Caesan has an oversize brain with enhanced cognitive development structures; i.e. social hierarchies, memory recall, complex thought. The Harridan instead has enhanced structures in more basic areas; motor control, spatial awareness, visual analysis. It is an idiot savant, specialised into flight control and tool usage (unfortunately for us, a sniper rifle is ultimately just another type of tool).</desc>
