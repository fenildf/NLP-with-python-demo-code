<desc>Androns are bipedal robotic infantry. They stand approximately 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) tall and are constructed from the same alien materials as the hulls of alien craft. They are heavily armoured, utterly fearless and capable of firing heavy weapons on the move, but seemingly suffer from a lack of situational awareness - combat videos do not show a single instance of an Andron taking cover. Perhaps the aliens believe their robotic guardians invulnerable to our weapons? Either way, you should exploit this flaw in their programming.&#10;&#10;The technology used in the recovered Andron is at once simple and complex. The design is elegant; an Alenium reactor is mounted within an armoured component in the droid's torso and uses a branching cable running down the back of the torso to distribute power to the rest of the body. Each joint contains an array of powerful hydraulics and servomotors, allowing fine control of each of the droid's robotic limbs. Though alien materials make this design more effective than anything we could create, the basic mechanical setup could be replicated using human technology without enormous difficulty. What human technology could never replicate is the complex network of sensors that fill almost every spare inch of the droid's internal space. We cannot even identify many of the instruments, but their collective role is obvious - recording data on the droid surroundings and feeding it to the processing units encased in its metal skull.&#10;&#10;While it is an extremely effective combat unit, we have genuine questions over why the Andron exists at all. The parallels with organic life are obvious and clearly deliberate. It has a reactor placed where a living creature would have a heart, an electronic brain inside its armoured head, even a power distribution system that mirrors the nervous system of a living creature. I can see no compelling reason to build a bipedal combat robot at all - a wheeled or tracked design would be more stable, faster moving, better protected and present a smaller battlefield target. Is it vanity? Stupidity? Puzzling, to say the least.</desc>
