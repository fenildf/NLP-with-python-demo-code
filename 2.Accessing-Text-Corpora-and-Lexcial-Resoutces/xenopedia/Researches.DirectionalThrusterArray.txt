<desc>Extraterrestrial craft are fascinating for many reasons, not least their extraordinary manuevering ability. Their fighters dance through the air like graceful ballerinas and even their ponderous capital ships can hover in place and turn far more quickly than their size should allow. It seems the recovered Directional Thruster array explains how this is possible.&#10;&#10;The device consists of a central &quot;brain&quot; and a series of rotatable thrusters mounted outside of the ship's hull. These thrusters were clearly originally designed for maneuvering in a vacuum, but during atmospheric flight take on the combined role of wings, stabilisers and elevators. An outer &quot;shell&quot; of tiny flaps, each able to provide tiny amounts of vectored thrust, allows an immense amount of control over the output of each individual thruster. Collectively, a network of a dozen or more of these thrusters gives a craft the ability to perform some fairly remarkable acrobatics. Though this system is hardly energy efficient compared to conventional flight control systems, alien craft generate enough power that this is not a problem.  &#10;&#10;The &quot;brain&quot; is an oval structure roughly the size of a car engine. It contains a crowded arrangement of sensors and a dense mass of biological electronics that we believe automatically stabilises the flight of the UFO based on the incoming sensor data. Unfortunately, this biological brain would be too complex to replicate - but it may be possible to substitute it. Automated control systems for spacecraft have been around for almost twenty years, so I imagine with a little time my team would be able to adapt and improve the existing designs to create something capable of controlling a few of these thrusters. We may not be able to create a system as elegant as the extraterrestrial one, but even a basic solution could dramatically improve the performance of our interceptors and dropships. </desc>
<cdesc>外星飞行器的不可思议之处有很多，尤其是他们绝佳的机动性。它们的战斗机能像优雅的芭蕾舞演员那样在空中舞动，即使是最笨重的主力舰也能稳定地悬浮在一个高度并以远超它们体积所能允许的速率转向。我们回收到的定向推进器阵列似乎能解释他们是怎么做到的。&#10;&#10;这个装置由一个中央&quot;大脑&quot;和一系列附着在船体外部的可转向的推进器组成，那些推进器显然最初被设计用来进行矢量机动，不过在大气层内飞行中，它们取代了机翼的作用,保障飞行稳定并使其能够升降。推进器&quot;外壳&quot;上还附着着大量的襟翼片，每片下面都是一个微型矢量推进器，这使得每个推进器的控制性能都发挥到了极限。当它们协同工作时，由一打甚至更多的推进器组成的网络能让飞行器做出各种不可思议的特技飞行。尽管跟传统的飞行控制系统相比它的能效比有些低，但在外星飞船的反应堆产能面前这不算是问题。  &#10;&#10;&quot;大脑&quot;是一个体积大约相当于一辆汽车引擎大小的椭圆形结构。它包括密密麻麻的传感器和稠密的生物质电路，我们相信UFO是通过传感器数据来实现飞行时的自动稳定。不幸的是，这个生物学意义上的准大脑太过于复杂以至于我们不可能复制它 - 但或许有可能找一个替代品来代替它。针对太空船的自动控制系统的研究早在二十多年前就开始进行，所以我想我的团队花一点时间就能将一个现有的设计适配并改良成能够控制几个定向推进器。我们制造的系统或许没法像外星人做的那么优雅，但即使是最简单的方案也能为我们的拦截机和运输机的性能带来戏剧性的提升。</cdesc>
