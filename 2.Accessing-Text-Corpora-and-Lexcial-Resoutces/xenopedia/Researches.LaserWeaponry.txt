<desc>Infantry laser weapons previously existed only in the realms of science fiction. Any laser powerful enough to be a viable combat weapon would need a battery the size of a truck - the word &quot;impractical&quot; being an understatement.&#10;&#10;The arrival of alien technology has changed all of this. The enormous energy content of an Alenium crystal allows a battery no larger than a standard ammunition magazine to generate up to a dozen laser beams, each capable of burning through an inch of steel. Superconducting ceramics can be used to cool the weapon, storing the waste heat from each shot and dissipating slowly enough to avoid injury (provided one is careful where they place their hands). This eliminates the need for bulky refrigeration units, reducing the size and weight of the weapons significantly.  &#10;&#10;In order to minimise adjustment time for our troops, our laser weapons have been designed to operate like conventional firearms and have similar range and accuracy to their predecessors. There are some notable differences, most obviously the improved damage thermal shock weapons inflict upon their targets. Less favourably, a laser weapon will have roughly half the ammunition capacity of a ballistic weapon. In order to streamline this process, we have designed a single standardised battery for all of our laser weapons. The design is not complex; a cylindrical steel jacket that contains an Alenium crystal and locks into the weapon with a simple twist. These power cells are trivial to manufacture compared to the weapons themselves, so are available in effectively unlimited quantities.&#10;&#10;Be aware that manufacturing these weapons consumes a large amount of alien alloys and is both expensive and time consuming - but I still believe they represent a good investment despite this. At the very least, some new toys may raise morale amongst your men.</desc>
