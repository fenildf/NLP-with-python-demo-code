<desc>You've probably already noticed we're being invaded, Commander, so I won't state the obvious. The situation is bleak; none of the major powers are able to defend their own airspace, let alone protect the rest of the planet.&#10;&#10;It seems things are up to us. My team stand ready to help - there may only be a handful of us, but some of the finest minds on the planet are at work in your laboratories (this organisation offers a certain freedom from intrusion that appeals to those of intelligence). The key to beating our enemies is to understand them; we are keen to study any extraterrestrial equipment you can recover from the battlefield. In the meantime, we have been gathering intelligence on the size and composition of the alien fleet orbiting our planet - mostly images and data obtained from orbital satellites or ground-based observatories. Given the depressingly disjointed response from the rest of the planet, this is probably the most in-depth study of the invasion to date.&#10;&#10;We have conclusively identified over three thousand separate UFOs in orbit around the planet, with several times that amount of additional probable signals. The fleet is comprised of craft of various sizes: the UFOs already sighted entering our atmosphere represent the smallest orbital signatures detected, while the largest signals identified appear to be enormous warships with dimensions rivalling that of modern aircraft carriers.&#10;&#10;A glimmer of hope remains - the alien craft seem poorly suited to atmospheric flight. Our interceptors may enjoy some early success against the superior extraterrestrial vessels simply due to better adaptation to the combat environment. This may also explain the appearance of only relatively small craft in the skies above our planet - our scientists theorise that the aliens will have to modify their craft to enter our atmosphere. The larger the craft, the longer this will take. If they are correct, the largest craft will only appear in the later stages of the invasion. Perhaps this will afford humanity (read: us) enough time to organise a more  effective defence.&#10;&#10;I have two recommendations: that we consider supplementing our existing F-17 Condor aircraft with a heavier interceptor capable of carrying more powerful weapons, and that we investigate some form of battlefield support vehicle to aid our soldiers when securing crashed alien craft. Both proposals are already on your desk.</desc>
