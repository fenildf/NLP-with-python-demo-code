<desc>A Wraith stands roughly 180cm (6 foot) tall and is probably the most exotic of the extraterrestrials encountered to date. Only vaguely humanoid, it has triple-jointed legs and a bulbous head with a glowing, fleshy protrusion on each side. Disturbingly, they are reported to possess the ability to teleport around the battlefield - allegedly even through solid objects. &#10;&#10;Wraiths have a well-developed muscular system that is otherwise unremarkable, leaving them closely matched with humans in terms of strength and resilience. They possess four main internal organs, all of which are completely unrecognisable and appear to have hybrid functions. Each is protected by surgically implanted armour plating composed of the same materials used in UFO construction, though in this case it is only a few millimetres thick and possesses unusual flexibility. It appears both effective and unobtrusive; quite why subdermal armour is not present in other aliens we cannot say. This suggests these aliens have an important role within the alien hierarchy. Though I doubt we are looking at the alien leaders, the Wraiths may well represent the alien elite forces.&#10;&#10;The vast heads of these creatures contains a thick skull reinforced with protective armour plate, underneath which lies an expansive brain. The glowing nodules on either side of the skull comprise largely soft tissue packed with respiratory cells that produce immense amounts of energy (the glow seems to be a side-effect of this). These biological reactions consume almost fifty thousand calories every hour and thus cannot be a product of natural evolution. The only plausible explanation is that it is fed directly into the bloodstream through the ubiquitous valves surgically implanted into the necks of extraterrestrial soldiers. &#10;&#10;The other discovery of note is that these nodules sit atop an opening in the skull, meaning any blow of significant force would likely kill the creature outright (a bullet will certainly do the job). As the rest of the skull is well-protected, these nodules must be extremely important - likely linked to the power of teleportation. We plan to amputate them from any live specimen captured immediately to test the theory - if it does not teleport out of its containment tank once it regains consciousness, we will be proved correct. If not, I foresee having some difficulty interrogating the beast...</desc>
