<desc>The Harridan is by some distance the most relaxed of all our captives - indeed, I occasionally wonder if it is even aware of its confinement. The creature is sealed within an armoured suit that cannot be removed without killing it; our holding tank may be the lesser of two prisons.&#10;&#10;Performing analysis on the Harridan has been a frustrating experience. It seems largely oblivious to our existence, so attracting its attention and engaging it in evaluatory tests is difficult. Our conclusions so far support the theory that these creatures are savants, demonstrating remarkable manual dexterity and an exceptional ability to process visual / spatial information but little interest in any task that employs higher brain function. Perhaps they see warfare as a simple mechanical task, nothing more than lining up their weapons and pulling the trigger. They may not even be aware that we are living creatures (assuming they are able to grasp the philosophical concept of &quot;life&quot;) at all. &#10;&#10;It seems these creatures are pitiful living tools, capable of limited emotion and little advanced thought. Ultimately this does not make them any less effective battlefield implements; they are still superb marksmen and have excellent sight ranges. In an attempt to even the odds, we have summarised the most vulnerable areas of the Harridan armoured suit in a document and issued it to your men. This should boost their damage against this species by approximately ten percent.</desc>
