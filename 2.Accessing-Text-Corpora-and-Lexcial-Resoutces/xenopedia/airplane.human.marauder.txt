<desc>The X-59 &quot;Marauder&quot; is an advanced interceptor designed to counter all known alien craft. It is fast, durable and well-armed (equipped with both a cannon and heavy torpedoes) and can perform the Combat Roll maneuver in combat. These characteristics make it just as adept at dealing with small alien interceptors as it is attacking large capital ships.&#10;&#10;Our greatest advances in performance came from setting aside the old conventions of aircraft design. The fuselage of the Marauder contains a network of powerful integrated thrusters that provide lift and propulsion, with the stubby forward-swept wings mostly being employed for fine maneuvering. While these wings contribute heavily to the overall agility of the interceptor, it is actually entirely capable of flying without them. The same can be said for the tail / vertical stabilisers, where the traditional vertical arrangement has also been replaced with a more unusual forked design.&#10;&#10;With few aerodynamic concerns, we have been able to focus our attention on combat performance instead. The armour plated &quot;shell&quot; of the craft is fabricated entirely from hardened alien materials and is nearly four inches thick in some areas, making it more akin to a flying tank than a normal interceptor. The extra engine thrust allows it to carry both a cannon and heavy torpedoes, making it a much more rounded combatant than any of its predecessors. The resulting interceptor is squat, ugly and capable of destroying almost anything it encounters (much like our engineers).</desc>
<cdesc>X-59 “掠夺者” 是一种被设计用来对付所有已知外星飞行器的高科技截击机。其速度快、耐久度高、装备精良（同时装备有机炮和重型鱼雷）并且能完成作战机动滚这样的战术动作。它的这些特点既适用于对付小型外星截击机，又能用来攻击大型旗舰飞船。&#10;&#10;之所以在性能上取得如此重大的进步，在于我们将旧的飞行器设计惯例抛诸脑后。“掠夺者”的机身包含了一套强大的整合推进器网络系统，用来提供升力和推进力，还包含有粗短的常用来改善机动性能的前掠翼。虽然这些机翼在截击机的灵活性方面贡献良多，但其实完全可以在不需要它们的情况下进行飞行。同样的道理也适用于垂直尾翼，我们用不寻常的叉状设计替代了传统的垂直排列设计。&#10;&#10;没有了空气动力学方面的顾虑，我们终于能够全身心投入到战斗性能设计上来。这种飞行器的装甲板&quot;外壳&quot; 完完全全是用锻造的外星材料制成，在某些区域厚度几乎达到了四英寸，这让它看起来更像是一辆会飞的坦克而非普通的截击机。引擎提供的额外推力使其能够同时搭载机炮和重型鱼雷，让其比前辈们具有更全面的作战能力。如此设计出的这种截击机，又胖又丑但却具备摧毁一切所遇之敌的能力（就像我们的工程师一样）。</cdesc>
