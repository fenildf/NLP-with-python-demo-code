<desc>This low-grade Alenium can also be used to upgrade the missiles carried by our interceptors. This process was slightly more involved, as our anti-air warheads rely on armour penetration as much as explosive force. Nonetheless, we have been successful - and as the new warheads can be fitted to our existing rocket engines, we have already upgraded your interceptors accordingly.&#10;&#10;The required armour penetration is achieved by fitting a small laser emitter to the top of the Alenium block. This fires in a pre-determined pattern, which can be changed to allow us to shape and focus the explosive charge in any direction that we choose. With no time to conduct extensive studies on the effectiveness of different charge patterns, we instead just ensured that the energy from the blast is focused forwards rather than wastefully radiating in all directions. Crude, perhaps, but certainly functional.&#10;&#10;The Alenium Missile is a direct replacement for the Sidewinder light air-to-air missile, whilst the Alenium Torpedo replaces the heavy Avalanche torpedo. The latter is a powerful weapon well suited to dealing with lumbering alien craft without the speed or agility to avoid it, the former a faster missile that inflicts less damage but is more likely to hit alien lighter vessels. In both cases the upgrades are just straightforward warhead swaps, so this should not dictate any major change in aerial tactics beyond making our engagements a little easier.</desc>
<cdesc>低等的 Alenium 还可以用来升级截击机的导弹。但由于对空导弹的弹头不仅仅需要爆炸的冲击力，还需要足够的装甲穿透力来发挥作用，升级过程稍微复杂一些。尽管如此，我们还是取得了成功！这些新式弹头与已有的推进器是兼容的，所以我们已经完成了对截击机的升级。导弹所需要的装甲穿透力，通过在一块 Alenium 顶部加装一个小型激光发射器来实现。这个激光发射器会按照预先设定的模式发射激光。通过控制激光的模式，我们就能够控制 Alenium 能量释放的方向。由于没有时间来进行针对这一课题更加细致的研究，现阶段我们仅仅将 Alenium 能量释放的方向集中于导弹正前方，而不是分散释放到各个方向。虽然方法上略显粗暴，但是很有效果。Alenium 导弹可以替换“响尾蛇”轻型空对空导弹，Alenium 鱼雷可以用来替换“雪崩”重型鱼雷。Alenium 鱼雷是一种对重型外星飞船非常有效的武器，因为这些飞船没有足够的速度和灵活性来规避它。Alenium 导弹虽然威力稍小一些，但是速度更快，更容易击中轻型外星飞船。这两种升级都仅仅是对弹头的更换，所以除了让任务的执行稍微简单一些之外，不会对我们的空中战术造成太大影响。</cdesc>
