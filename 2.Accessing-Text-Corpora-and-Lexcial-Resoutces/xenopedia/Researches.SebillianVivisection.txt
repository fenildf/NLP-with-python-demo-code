<desc>I am impressed, Commander - quite how your men managed to subdue such a creature is beyond me. Now it has been safely confined in a containment tank, we have been able to perform a detailed analysis on it. The tests confirmed our initial suspicions: Sebillians possess only rudimentary intelligence, have bad eyesight and struggle to operate firearms. However, they are remarkably agile for such hulking creatures and can cover ground surprisingly quickly. &#10;&#10;They also possess astonishing regenerative abilities. Unless the creature is actually dead, it will regenerate virtually any damage sustained to its body (brain included) in a matter of minutes. This ability seems to arise from unspecialised stem cells in the Sebillian bloodstream, which replicate at an incredible rate and can replace complex organs such as eyes or nerves just as easily as simpler structures such as muscle tissue. Clearly, the volume of tissue being regenerated is too great for this to be a natural process. We believe inherent regenerative abilities are being supercharged by the nanoparticles of Alenium in alien blood serum, providing the vast quantity of energy needed to rebuild entire body parts in minutes rather than weeks.&#10;&#10;This analysis has brought two tangible results. The first is an upgrade to our battlefield medipacks, which borrow from alien nanotechnology to help stabilise battlefield injuries (sadly full-blown tissue regeneration would require decades of genetic engineering). These improved medipacks replace our previous ones and will heal at twice the rate. The second result is a summary of known Sebillian weaknesses, which should cause your men to inflict approximately ten percent more damage when fighting these enemies.&#10;</desc>
