<desc>Good news, Commander. I have developed a method of shaping captured alien alloys, allowing us to incorporate them into our designs for the first time. This is largely a result of tapping the vast reserves of energy locked away inside our stores of Alenium; though the foundry processes are a little more complex than simply blasting the materials with our upgraded laboratory lasers until they melt, for the sake of brevity I will leave the explanation at that.&#10;&#10;Needless to say, this is a discovery of enormous significance. We can vastly improve the efficiency of our existing technology with alien materials, but they also open the door to ideas that seemed impossible only a few weeks ago. The frontiers of science have moved more in the past few months than they did in the previous century; some of these alloys have properties that barely even exist in theoretical science. I must admit that my team are struggling with the pace of advance - we are sometimes as much limited by our scientific education as we are enlightened by it.&#10;&#10;The proposal for developing improved battlefield infantry armour with these materials may therefore seem a little underwhelming, but it marks only the start of what we can achieve. I would not be surprised if we were building whole vehicles or entire aircraft out of them soon.  In the meantime, if you see any off-duty scientists strolling around the base, please remind them that: (a) they should be in bed, and that (b) research materials should stay within the laboratory at all times. The number of unauthorised &quot;upgrades&quot; appearing across the base is matched only by the amount of yawning in my labs. </desc>
<cdesc>好消息，指挥官！我们新开发出了一种外星合金改造技术。这让我们首次能够将外星合金使用在我们的设计中。这项发明的产生主要得益于我们开发出了合理的方法，来使用 Alenium 中储存的巨大能量。虽然改造合金的过程要比简单使用经过改造的实验室激光将合金炙烤到熔融状态要稍微复杂一些。为了让这份报告简洁一些，就不在这里进行解释了。显而易见，这是一项非常重要的发明。使用外星材料，不仅能够极大提升我们现有科技的效率，而且还为我们的一些想法提供了新的思路。这些想法在几周前还被认为是不可实现的。在最近的几个月，前沿科学的进展比过去一个世纪还要多。有些外星合金具有一些在理论科学中不曾出现过的奇特性质。我必须承认，我的团队为这种进展的速度感到苦恼，我们所受到的科学教育曾经启迪过我们，但现在却限制住了我们的认知。用这些外星合金来开发战地单兵装甲的提案看起来可能稍微有些初级，但这仅仅是个开始。毫无疑问，在不久的将来，我们就能够用外星合金制造整部车辆或整架飞船。另外，如果你看到了一些科学家下班后在基地中游荡，麻烦你提醒他们：(a)他们应该去休息(b)不允许将实验材料带出实验室。基地中未经授权的“升级”事件数和我的实验室中的哈欠数成正比。</cdesc>
