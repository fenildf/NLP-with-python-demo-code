<desc>Our enemies are members of a vast stellar empire that spans several galaxies and hundreds of planets; this invasion fleet is only a tiny fraction of their military might (although considered more than enough to deal with us). This empire has existed for millennia, linked by ships that can travel interstellar distances in days. With no rivals to define itself against, it seemingly has no name. They believe no other interstellar civilisation exists, or ever has.&#10;&#10;This empire is ruled by a caste of living god-creatures known as the Praetors. While the lesser creatures are clones that follow orders unquestioningly, these Praetors seem distinct individuals locked in an endless struggle with one another for power and influence. Low-ranking praetors are apparently present on the largest alien craft / bases, overseeing the work of their underlings directly. These creatures will surely know the true reason why the extraterrestrials have travelled to our planet, the real reasons behind the invasion. We must capture one alive, whatever the cost may be.&#10;&#10;I have little doubt the task will be difficult. During the questioning of our captive, I could not help but notice the interrogation team becoming steadily less adversarial - indeed, after six hours, they had almost become friendly. Alarmed, I called a halt to the experiment and had the captive terminated. It emerged that one of my scientists had slipped into a trance during the interrogation and surreptitiously begun building a bomb large enough to blow up half the facility. Given a few more hours, he might well have finished the job. Dark days, Commander: it appears these creatures are capable of manipulating our very minds.</desc>
